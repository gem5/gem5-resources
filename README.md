# gem5 Resources

This repository contains the sources needed to compile the gem5 resources.
The compiled resources are found in the gem5 resources bucket,
http://dist.gem5.org/dist. Though these resources are not needed to compile or
run gem5, they may be required to execute some gem5 tests or may be useful
when carrying out specific simulations.

The following sections outline our versioning policy, how to make changes
to this repository, and describe each resource and how they may be built.

## Versioning

We ensure that for each version of the [gem5 source](
https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5/) there is a corresponding version of
the gem5-resources, with the assumption that version X of the gem5 source will
be used with version X of the gem5-resources. The gem5-resources repository
contains two branches, develop and stable. The stable branch's HEAD points
towards the latest gem5 resources release, which will be the same version id
as the that of the latest gem5 source. E.g., if the latest release of gem5 is
v20.2.0.0, then the latest release of gem5-resources will be v20.2.0.0, with
the HEAD of its stable branch tagged as v20.2.0.0. Previous versions will be
tagged within the stable branch. Past versions gem5-resources can thereby be
checked out with `git checkout <VERSION>`. A complete list of versions can be
found with `git tag`. The develop branch contains code under development and
will be merged into the stable branch, then tagged, as part of the next release
of gem5. More information on gem5 release procedures can be found [here](
https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5/+/refs/heads/stable/CONTRIBUTING.md#releases).
Any release procedures related to the gem5 source can be assumed to be
applicable to gem5-resources.

The compiled resources for gem5 can be found under
http://dist.gem5.org/dist/{VERSION}. E.g. compiled resources for gem5 v20.2
are under http://dist.gem5.org/dist/v20-2 and are compiled from
gem5-resources v20.2. http://dist.gem5.org/dist/develop is kept in sync
with the develop branch, and therefore should not be depended upon for stable,
regular usage.

**Note: Resource files for gem5 v19.0.0.0, our legacy release, can be found
under http://dist.gem5.org/dist/current**.

## Making Changes

Changes to this repository are made to the develop branch via our Gerrit
code review system. Therefore, to make changes, first clone the repository
checkout the develop branch:

```
git clone https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources
git checkout --track origin/develop
```

Then make changes and commit. When ready, push to Gerrit with:

```
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/develop
```

The change will then be reviewed via our [Gerrit code review system](
https://gem5-review.googlesource.com). Once fully accepted and merged into
the gem5-resources repository, please contact Bobby R. Bruce
[bbruce@ucdavis.edu](mailto:bbruce@ucdavis.edu) to have the compiled sources
uploaded to the gem5 resources bucket.

## Resource: RISCV Tests

The RISCV Tests source can be found in the `src/riscv-tests` directory. More
information about these tests can be found in `src/riscv-tests/README.md`.

### RISCV Tests Origins

The RISCV Tests in this repository were obtained from
<https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests.git>, revision
e65ecdf941a5484af27f9be223fb655ebcb0398b.

### RISCV Tests Compilation

To compile the RISCV Tests the [RISCV GNU Compiler](
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain) must be installed.

Then, to compile:

```
cd src/riscv-tests
autoconf
./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv/target
RISCV_PREFIX=<COMPILER_PREFIX> make
```
As an example for `make`, if the binary name for the RISCV compiler is
`riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc`, then the make command is the following:
```
RISCV_PREFIX=riscv64-linux-gnu- make
```
This RISCV binaries can then be found within the `src/riscv-tests/benchmarks`
directory.

## Resource: simple

The simple resources are small binaries, often used to run quick tests and
checks in gem5. They are baremetal.

### simple Compilation

Simple single source file per executable userland or baremetal examples.

The toplevel executables under `src/simple` can be built for any ISA that we
have a cross compiler for. The current cross compilers supported are :

- `x86_64` (as installed via APT with `sudo apt install build-essential`)
- [`aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc/arch64-linux-gnu-g++`](
https://preshing.com/20141119/how-to-build-a-gcc-cross-compiler/)
- [`arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++`](
https://preshing.com/20141119/how-to-build-a-gcc-cross-compiler/)
- [`riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc/riscv64-linux-gnu-g++`](
https://preshing.com/20141119/how-to-build-a-gcc-cross-compiler/)

Examples that build only for some ISAs specific ones are present under
`src/simple/<ISA>` subdirs, e.g. `src/simple/aarch64/`,

The ISA names are meant to match `uname -m`, e.g.:

- `aarch64`
- `arm`
- `riscv`
- `x86_64`
- `sparc64`

You have to specify the path to the gem5 source code with `GEM5_ROOT` variable so that
m5ops can be used from there. For example for a native build:

    cd src/simple
    make -j`nproc` GEM5_ROOT=../../../

The default of that variable is such that if you place this repository and the gem5
repository in the same directory:

    ./gem5/
    ./gem5-resources/

you can omit that variable and build just with:

    make

After the building, the generated files are located under:

    ./out/<ISA>/

For example, some of the userland executables built on x86 are:

    ./out/x86_64/user/hello.out
    ./out/x86_64/user/x86_64/mwait.out

Or if you build for a different ISA:

    make ISA=aarch64

some of the executables would be:

    ./out/aarch64/user/hello.out
    ./out/aarch64/user/aarch64/futex_ldxr_stxr.out

By default, only userland executables are built. You can build just the baremetal
ones instead with:

    make ISA=aarch64 bare

or both userland and baremetal with:

    make ISA=aarch64 all

A sample baremetal executable generated by this is:

    out/aarch64/bare/m5_exit.out

Only ISAs that have a corresponding `src/simple/bootloader/` file can build for
baremetal, e.g. `src/simple/bootloader/aarch64.S`.

Note that a some C source files can produce both a baremetal and an userland.
For example `m5_exit.c` produces both:

    out/aarch64/bare/m5_exit.out
    out/aarch64/user/m5_exit.out

However, since the regular userland toolchain is used rather than a more
specialized baremetal toolchain, the C standard library is not available.
Therefore, only very few C examples can build for baremetal, notably the ones
that use m5ops.

There are also examples that can only build for baremetal, e.g.
`aarch64/semihost_exit` only builds for baremetal, as semihosting is not
available on userland.

The `simple` directory is also able to generate squashfs images containing
only a single userland executable at `/sbin/init` for any of the userland
executables. This can be done with a command of type:

    make ISA=aarch64 out/aarch64/squashfs/m5_exit.squashfs

Squashfs is a filesystem type that the Linux kernel understands natively,
exactly like ext4, except that it is a bit more convenient to create, and
write-only.

You can therefore give those squashfs images to gem5 exactly as you
would give a normal ext4 raw image, by pointing to it for example with
`fs.py --disk-image=m5_exit.squashfs` as shown at:
https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/fullsystem/building_arm_kernel
Linux will then run the given userland executable after Linux boots as the
init program.

The initial motivation for this was to generate simple test images for
Linux boot.

Since this is a less common use case, squashfs images are not currently
generated by any single phony target all at once.

## Resource: Square

### Square Compilation

To compile:

**Note**: Make sure you are in gem5-resources directory (resources like square are not present in the gem5 repository)
To clone the gem5-resources repository, run the following command:

```
git clone https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources
```


```
cd src/gpu/square
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu make gfx8-apu
```

The compiled binary can be found in `src/gpu/square/bin`

### Square Pre-built binary

<http://dist.gem5.org/dist/v22-0/test-progs/square/square>

# Resource: HSA Agent Packet Example

Based off of the Square resource in this repository, this resource serves as
an example for using an HSA Agent Packet to send commands to the GPU command
processor included in the GCN_X86 build of gem5.

The example command extracts the kernel's completion signal from the domain
of the command processor and the GPU's dispatcher. Initially this was a
workaround for the hipDeviceSynchronize bug, now fixed. The method of
waiting on a signal can be applied to other agent packet commands though.

Custom commands can be added to the command processor in gem5 to control
the GPU in novel ways.

## Compilation

To compile:

```
cd src/gpu/hsa-agent-pkt
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu make gfx8-apu
```

The compiled binary can be found in `src/gpu/hsa-agent-pkt/bin`

# Resource: HIP Sample Applications

The [HIP sample apps](
https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/tree/roc-1.6.0/samples) contain
applications that introduce various GPU programming concepts that are usable
in HIP.

The samples cover topics such as using and accessing different parts of GPU
memory, running multiple GPU streams, and optimization techniques for GPU code.

Certain apps aren't included due to complexities with either ROCm or Docker
(hipEvent, profiler), or due to lack of feature support in gem5 (peer2peer)

## Compilation

```
cd src/gpu/hip-samples
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu make
```

Individual programs can be made by specifying the name of the program

By default, this code builds for gfx801, a GCN3-based APU. This can be
overridden by specifying `-e HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET=<target>` in the build command.

# Resource: Heterosync

[Heterosync](https://github.com/mattsinc/heterosync) is a benchmark suite used
to test the performance of various types of fine-grained synchronization on
tightly-coupled GPUs. The version in gem5-resources contains only the HIP code.

The README in the heterosync folder details the various synchronization primitives
and the other command-line arguments for use with heterosync.

## Compilation
```
cd src/gpu/heterosync
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu make release-gfx8
```

The release-gfx8 target builds for gfx801, a GCN3-based APU, and gfx803, a
GCN3-based dGPU. There are other targets (release) that build for GPU types
that are currently unsupported in gem5.

# Resource: lulesh

[lulesh](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/co-design/lulesh) is a DOE proxy
application that is used as an example of hydrodynamics modeling. The version
provided is for use with the gpu-compute model of gem5.

## Compilation and Running
```
cd src/gpu/lulesh
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu make
```

By default, the Makefile builds for gfx801, and is placed in the `src/gpu/lulesh/bin` folder.

lulesh is a GPU application, which requires that gem5 is built with the GCN3_X86 architecture.
To build GCN3_X86:

```
# Working directory is your gem5 directory
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu scons -sQ -j$(nproc) build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt
```

The following command shows how to run lulesh

Note: lulesh has two optional command-line arguments, to specify the stop time and number
of iterations. To set the arguments, add `--options="<stop_time> <num_iters>`
to the run command. The default arguments are equivalent to `--options="1.0e-2 10"`


```
# Assuming gem5 and gem5-resources are in your working directory
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu gem5/build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt gem5/configs/example/apu_se.py -n3 --mem-size=8GB --benchmark-root=gem5-resources/src/gpu/lulesh/bin -clulesh
```

# Resource: halo-finder (HACC)

[HACC](https://asc.llnl.gov/coral-2-benchmarks) is a DoE application designed to simulate the
evolution of the universe by simulating the formation of structure in collisionless fluids
under the influence of gravity. The halo-finder code can be GPU accelerated by using
the code in RCBForceTree.cxx

`src/gpu/halo-finder/src` contains the code required to build and run ForceTreeTest from `src/halo_finder` in the main HACC codebase.
`src/gpu/halo-finder/src/dfft` contains the dfft code from `src/dfft` in the main HACC codebase.

## Compilation and Running

halo-finder requires that certain libraries that aren't installed by default in the
GCN3 docker container provided by gem5, and that the environment is configured properly
in order to build. We provide a Dockerfile that installs those libraries and
sets the environment.

In order to test the GPU code in halo-finder, we compile and run ForceTreeTest.

To build the Docker image and the benchmark:
```
cd src/gpu/halo-finder
docker build -t <image_name> .
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD}/src -u $UID:$GID <image_name> make hip/ForceTreeTest
```

The binary is built for gfx801 by default and is placed at `src/gpu/halo-finder/src/hip/ForceTreeTest`

ForceTreeTest is a GPU application, which requires that gem5 is built with the GCN3_X86 architecture.
To build GCN3_X86:
```
# Working directory is your gem5 directory
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID <image_name> scons -sQ -j$(nproc) build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt
```

To run ForceTreeTest:
```
# Assuming gem5 and gem5-resources are in the working directory
docker run --rm -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD -u $UID:$GID <image_name> gem5/build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt gem5/configs/example/apu_se.py -n3 --benchmark-root=gem5-resources/src/gpu/halo-finder/src/hip -cForceTreeTest --options="0.5 0.1 64 0.1 1 N 12 rcb"
```

# Resource: DNNMark

[DNNMark](https://github.com/shidong-ai/DNNMark) is a benchmark framework used
to characterize the performance of deep neural network (DNN) primitive workloads.

## Compilation and Running

To build DNNMark:
**NOTE**: Due to DNNMark building a library, it's important to mount gem5-resources
to the same directory within the docker container when building and running, as otherwise the benchmarks
won't be able to link against the library. The example commands do this by using
`-v ${PWD}:${PWD}` in the docker run commands
```
cd src/gpu/DNNMark
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu ./setup.sh HIP
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD}/build -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu make
```

DNNMark uses MIOpen kernels, which are unable to be compiled on-the-fly in gem5.
We have provided a python script to generate these kernels for a subset of the
benchmarks for a gfx801 GPU with 4 CUs by default

To generate the MIOpen kernels:
```
cd src/gpu/DNNMark
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -v${PWD}/cachefiles:/root/.cache/miopen/2.9.0 -w ${PWD} ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu python3 generate_cachefiles.py cachefiles.csv [--gfx-version={gfx801,gfx803}] [--num-cus=N]
```

Due to the large amounts of memory that need to be set up for DNNMark, we have
added in the ability to MMAP a file to reduce setup time, as well as added a
program that can generate a 2GB file of floats.

To make the MMAP file:
```
cd src/gpu/DNNMark
g++ -std=c++0x generate_rand_data.cpp -o generate_rand_data
./generate_rand_data
```

DNNMark is a GPU application, which requires that gem5 is built with the GCN3_X86 architecture.
To build GCN3_X86:
```
# Working directory is your gem5 directory
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu scons -sQ -j$(nproc) build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt
```

To run one of the benchmarks (fwd softmax) in gem5:
```
# Assuming gem5 and gem5-resources are sub-directories of the current directory
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -v ${PWD}/gem5-resources/src/gpu/DNNMark/cachefiles:/root/.cache/miopen/2.9.0 -w ${PWD} ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu gem5/build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt gem5/configs/example/apu_se.py -n3 --benchmark-root=gem5-resources/src/gpu/DNNMark/build/benchmarks/test_fwd_softmax -cdnnmark_test_fwd_softmax --options="-config gem5-resources/src/gpu/DNNMark/config_example/softmax_config.dnnmark -mmap gem5-resources/src/gpu/DNNMark/mmap.bin"
```


# Resource: pennant

pennant is an unstructured mesh physics mini-app designed for advanced
architecture research.  It contains mesh data structures and a few
physics algorithms adapted from the LANL rad-hydro code FLAG, and gives
a sample of the typical memory access patterns of FLAG.

## Compiling and Running

```
cd src/gpu/pennant
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu make
```

By default, the binary is built for gfx801 and is placed in `src/gpu/pennant/build`

pennant is a GPU application, which requires that gem5 is built with the GCN3_X86 architecture.

pennant has sample input files located at `src/gpu/pennant/test`. The following command shows how to run the sample `noh`

```
# Assuming gem5 and gem5-resources are in your working directory
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu gem5/build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt gem5/configs/example/apu_se.py -n3 --benchmark-root=gem5-resources/src/gpu/pennant/build -cpennant --options="gem5-resources/src/gpu/pennant/test/noh/noh.pnt"
```

The output gets placed in `src/gpu/pennant/test/noh/`, and the file `noh.xy`
against the `noh.xy.std` file. Note: Only some tests have `.xy.std` files to

### Insttest Compilation

To compile:

```
cd src/insttest
make
```

We provide a docker image with a pre-loaded SPARC cross compiler. To use:

```
cd src/insttest
docker run --volume $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) --rm ghcr.io/gem5/sparc64-gnu-cross:latest make
```

The compiled binary can be found in `src/insttest/bin`.
