""" Script to run NAS parallel benchmarks with gem5.
    The script expects kernel, diskimage, mem_sys,
    cpu (kvm, atomic, or timing), benchmark to run
    and number of cpus as arguments.

    If your application has ROI annotations, this script will count the total
    number of instructions executed in the ROI. It also tracks how much
    wallclock and simulated time.
