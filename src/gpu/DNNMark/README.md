[DNNMark](https://github.com/shidong-ai/DNNMark) is a benchmark framework used
to characterize the performance of deep neural network (DNN) primitive workloads.

The gem5 DNNMark tests can be used to test the GCN3-GPU model.

Compiling DNNMark, compiling the GCN3_X86 gem5, and running DNNMark on gem5 is dependent on the gcn-gpu docker image, built from the `util/dockerfiles/gcn-gpu/Dockerfile` on the [gem5 stable branch](https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5/+/refs/heads/stable).

## Compilation and Running

To build DNNMark:
**NOTE**: Due to DNNMark building a library, it's important to mount gem5-resources
to the same directory within the docker container when building and running, as otherwise the benchmarks
won't be able to link against the library. The example commands do this by using
`-v ${PWD}:${PWD}` in the docker run commands
```
cd src/gpu/DNNMark
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:v22-1 ./setup.sh HIP
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD}/build -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:v22-1 make
```

DNNMark uses MIOpen kernels, which are unable to be compiled on-the-fly in gem5.
We have provided a python script to generate these kernels for a subset of the
benchmarks for a gfx801 GPU with 4 CUs by default

To generate the MIOpen kernels:
```
cd src/gpu/DNNMark
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -v${PWD}/cachefiles:/root/.cache/miopen/2.9.0 -w ${PWD} ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:v22-1 python3 generate_cachefiles.py cachefiles.csv [--gfx-version={gfx801,gfx803}] [--num-cus=N]
```

Due to the large amounts of memory that need to be set up for DNNMark, we have
added in the ability to MMAP a file to reduce setup time, as well as added a
program that can generate a 2GB file of floats.

To make the MMAP file:
```
cd src/gpu/DNNMark
g++ -std=c++0x generate_rand_data.cpp -o generate_rand_data
./generate_rand_data
```

DNNMark is a GPU application, which requires that gem5 is built with the GCN3_X86 architecture.
To build GCN3_X86:
```
# Working directory is your gem5 directory
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:v22-1 scons -sQ -j$(nproc) build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt
```

To run one of the benchmarks (fwd softmax) in gem5:
```
# Assuming gem5 and gem5-resources are sub-directories of the current directory
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -v ${PWD}/gem5-resources/src/gpu/DNNMark/cachefiles:/root/.cache/miopen/2.9.0 -w ${PWD} ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:v22-1 gem5/build/GCN3_X86/gem5.opt gem5/configs/example/apu_se.py -n3 --benchmark-root=gem5-resources/src/gpu/DNNMark/build/benchmarks/test_fwd_softmax -cdnnmark_test_fwd_softmax --options="-config gem5-resources/src/gpu/DNNMark/config_example/softmax_config.dnnmark -mmap gem5-resources/src/gpu/DNNMark/mmap.bin"
```

# Announcement
DNNMark is now supporting MIOpen. Right now DNNMark can run on both AMD and Nvidia platform.
HCC, HIP, MIOpen and miopengemm are required in order to build MIOpen version of DNNMark.

# DNNMark
Configurable benchmark suite of Deep Neural Networks

DNNMark is a highly configurable, extensible, and flexible Deep Neural Network benchmark framework. In this benchmark suite, each of DNN primitive workloads can be easily invoked separately, without any sacrifice on configurability. One can specify any type of scenarios for benchmarking on an algorithm-specific level. Second, the actual measurement can be done during the execution of any specific kernel. Our framework allows us to ignore the setup stages and focus on only the training steps. Unlike other deep learning frameworks, attaching a real database
for training purposes is not mandatory anymore. This capability will greatly aid the computer architecture community, which is
more interested in designing/tuning hardware/software, and less interested in the details or configuration of the deep neural net.

Depending on the specific configuration, deep neural networks can involve combinations of DNN primitives. A model composed of two or more primitive functions may be more desirable in terms of performance evaluation. In such cases, a composed model rather than standalone primitives, are preferred. To provide this capability, DNNmark can be extended to more sophisticated DNN models, where layers are connected to, and dependent upon, each other.

## Configurability
This frame work provides configurability in both general and algorithm specific parameters. Users can do this through a plain-text configuration file. Several examples are provided inside config_example directory.
## Extensibility
New DNN models/scenarios can be easily built for benchmarking through configuration files
## Convenience
Designing benchmarks takes little effort thanks to its centralized library
## Diversity
DNNMark contains commonly-used DNN primitives and also provides an easy approach to compose a model

# Build and Usage

## OS, Library, and Software Prerequisite
OS: Ubuntu 16.04

CUDA related library: CUDA tool kit v8.0; CuDNN v5.0

Other Software: CMake v3.5.1; g++ v5.4.0

Google libraries: gflags (sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev); glog(sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev)

There is one known problem regarding gflags. Sometimes, the compile process complains that ‘gflags’ has not been declared. This could be related to the gflag version used. So the solution could be either downloading a latest one or changing the namespace name from 'gflags' to 'google'

## Build
After you download and unzip the DNNMark, you should go to its root directory and edit `setup.sh` to set up path to cuDNN. And then run `./setup.sh`. This will create a build directory and run cmake automatically. To build the code, go to build directory `build` and run `make`

## Usage
To run the benchmarks that have been built, go to the directory `build` and you will see a directory `benchmarks`. Go inside and select the benchmark you want to run. Run command `./[name of benchmark] -config [path to config file] -debuginfo [1 or 0]` to execute the benchmark.

If you want to include warm up phase in the benchmark, one suggestion is that you mannually add it in the source code and use `-warmup [1 or 0]` to toggle the usage of the warm up phase. You can find one example the test_alexnet benchmark.
