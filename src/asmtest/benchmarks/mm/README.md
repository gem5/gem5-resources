# MM Benchmark in riscv-tests

The mm benchmark is a component of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the matrix multiplication algorithm implementation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The mm benchmark aims to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of matrix multiplication, which is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and computational mathematics. Matrix multiplication involves multiplying two matrices to produce a resulting matrix. By running the mm benchmark on RISC-V processors, developers and researchers can assess the processor's ability to handle matrix operations efficiently and optimize performance for matrix-intensive workloads.
