# Memcpy Benchmark in riscv-tests

The memcpy benchmark is a component of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the memcpy (memory copy) operation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The memcpy benchmark aims to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the memcpy operation, which is used to copy a block of memory from one location to another. The memcpy operation is a fundamental operation in many software programs and can heavily impact system performance. By running the memcpy benchmark on RISC-V processors, developers and researchers can assess the processor's ability to handle memory operations efficiently and optimize performance for memory-intensive workloads.
