# PMP Benchmark in riscv-tests

The pmp benchmark is a component of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the Physical Memory Protection (PMP) feature on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The pmp benchmark aims to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the Physical Memory Protection feature, which provides fine-grained memory access control and protection mechanisms in RISC-V processors. PMP allows defining memory regions and access permissions for different parts of the system, enhancing security and isolation. By running the pmp benchmark on RISC-V processors, developers and researchers can assess the functionality and effectiveness of the PMP feature on the specific processor.
