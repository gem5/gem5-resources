# Towers Benchmark in riscv-tests

The towers benchmark is a component of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the towers of Hanoi algorithm implementation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The towers benchmark serves to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the towers of Hanoi algorithm, which is a classic recursive algorithm used to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The algorithm is known for its exponential time complexity of O(2^n). By running the towers benchmark on RISC-V processors, developers and researchers can assess the processor's ability to handle recursive algorithms and optimize performance for such scenarios.
