# Multiply Benchmark in riscv-tests

The multiply benchmark is a component of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the multiply operation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The multiply benchmark aims to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the multiply operation, which is used to perform multiplication of two numbers. Multiplication is a fundamental arithmetic operation and is widely used in various computational tasks. By running the multiply benchmark on RISC-V processors, developers and researchers can assess the processor's ability to handle multiplication operations efficiently and optimize performance for multiply-intensive workloads.
