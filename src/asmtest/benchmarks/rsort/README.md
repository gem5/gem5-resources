# RSort Benchmark in riscv-tests

The rsort benchmark is another component of the RISC-V Tests suite. It serves as a tool to evaluate the performance and correctness of the rsort (radix sort) algorithm implementation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The rsort benchmark aims to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the radix sort algorithm, which is a non-comparative sorting algorithm known for its linear time complexity. By executing the rsort benchmark on RISC-V processors, it allows developers and researchers to gauge the sorting capabilities of the processor architecture and the effectiveness of any optimization techniques employed.
