# VVADD Benchmark in riscv-tests

The vvadd benchmark is a component of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the vector-vector addition (VVADD) algorithm implementation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The vvadd benchmark aims to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the vector-vector addition algorithm, which involves adding corresponding elements of two vectors to produce a resulting vector. Vector operations are commonly used in various computational tasks, such as signal processing and scientific computing. By running the vvadd benchmark on RISC-V processors, developers and researchers can assess the processor's ability to handle vector operations efficiently and optimize performance for vector-intensive workloads.
