# SpMV Benchmark in riscv-tests

The spmv benchmark is a part of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) algorithm implementation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The spmv benchmark aims to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the SpMV algorithm, which is commonly used in scientific computing and graph algorithms. SpMV involves multiplying a sparse matrix with a dense vector and is known for its irregular memory access patterns. By running the spmv benchmark on RISC-V processors, developers and researchers can assess the processor's capability to handle irregular memory accesses and optimize performance for SpMV workloads.
