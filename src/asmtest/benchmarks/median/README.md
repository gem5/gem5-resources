# Median Benchmark in riscv-tests

The median benchmark is a component of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the median algorithm implementation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The median benchmark serves to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the median algorithm, which is used to find the middle value in a set of numbers. The algorithm typically requires sorting the input data and selecting the middle element. By running the median benchmark on RISC-V processors, developers and researchers can assess the processor's ability to handle sorting algorithms and optimize performance for scenarios that involve finding the median value.
