# QSort Benchmark in riscv-tests

The qsort benchmark is a part of the RISC-V Tests suite. It is designed to test the performance and correctness of the qsort (quick sort) algorithm implementation on RISC-V processors.

### Purpose

The qsort benchmark helps to assess the efficiency and correctness of the quicksort algorithm, which is a widely used sorting algorithm known for its average-case performance of O(n log n). By running the qsort benchmark on RISC-V processors, it allows developers and researchers to evaluate the sorting capabilities of the processor architecture and the effectiveness of any optimization techniques implemented.
